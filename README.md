# Node and React
 This application shows the user some random advice. It's a vehicle to test creating an Express server, calling that server from React, and then deploying to Heroku.

## Getting Started
All of the files can be loaded with your browser. Copy the files to your local directory, open a Git Terminal and type "node server.js". Then open another Git Terminal, cd client, and type "npm start". React will open a browser and on localhost:3000.

### Prerequisites
   * A browser. Chrome was used for testing. 
   * [Git terminal] https://git-scm.com/downloads

   #### Server:
   Type "npm install" to get the following prerequisites:
      * npm express
      * npm axios
      * npm nodemon

   #### Client:
   Type "npm install" to get the following prerequisites:
   * npm "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free"
   * npm "@testing-library/jest-dom"
   * npm "@testing-library/react"
   * npm "@testing-library/user-event"
   * npm axios
   * npm bootstrap
   * npm font-awesome
   * npm react
   * npm react-bootstrap
   * npm react-dom
   * npm react-scripts


### Installing
    1. Go to https://github.com/ruthtech/node-and-react and click on the "Clone or Download" button. 
    2. Choose "Download ZIP". 
    3. Unzip into a directory. If you're on Windows, open File Explorer and navigate to the download directory. Select the ZIP file, right click, and choose "Extract All". Accept the default location.
    4. Once the file is unzipped, navigate to note-taker-master and use your browser to open index.html.
    5. Install the prerequisites through your Git Terminal:
          * npm install (in the server directory)
          * npm install (in the client subdirectory)


## Running the tests
There are no automated tests.

### Manual tests (for the UI)
Start the server via your Git terminal:

    1. npm start

Then open a browser on "localhost:5000".
    1. When the browser is open, click on the button. Does the advice change?
